</p><br/>
## :star2: Project Description
The project was created in order to have a ready infrastructure. The aim of the project is to save time by using this skeleton when starting a new project. Thanks to the ready-made layers and the services prepared in it, the development phase can be started quickly. There is a sample object on how to use all processes in the project. The name of this object is the "Example" object. If something is forgotten during the development process, it is aimed to remind how to do it by looking at this object. On the basis of infrastructure;
